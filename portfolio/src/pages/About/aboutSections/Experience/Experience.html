                        I was a high-school student. One day I suddenly got intersted in the web-development and very fast it became my hobby. For the next few years in the free time I was developing UI for landing pages, static multipage websites and ReactJS applications just for fun (<a href="https://shoe-store-791ef.web.app/" target="_blank" class="link">example</a>).

                        For this one year I was working as one of the best online salesman in a very popular ukrainian franchise. What about my development practice, I faced the fact that I really lack the theory knowledges, so I had to pause my actual development process and start to learn. I've read a lot of documentation materials and these new knowledges really help me to develop websites much better.

                        I've quit my job and decided to pay more attention to my good-old web-development hobby. For this year I have developed a lot of very different websites, learnt many new technologies and development best-practices and became a freelancer on <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018487971326cfd290" target="_blank" title="My Upwork profile" class="link">Upwork</a>.
