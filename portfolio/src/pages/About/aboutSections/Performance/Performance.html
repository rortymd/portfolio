                    You can see the animations and the responsiveness with the naked eye. And what about the performance? By the performance I mean <b>high FPS value</b> during the attendance of a website, which means that I have to use very specific approaches in styling. In the front-end development, there are a lot of ways to achieve the same goal, but only an experienced developer knows, what they should use to prevent FPS drops and a long rendering time.

                    Except of the overall smoothness of a website, not less important are such criterios as <b>fast loading speed, accessability</b> and <b>SEO</b>. To improve these measures, I use the <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" class="link">PageSpeed Insights</a>, a service by Google. I have mastered the using of it, so I guarantee very high, <b>80+ points</b>, measurement values.
